# Frontend-Mentor-SnyderCut

In this repository I'll try to assemble every project I make from the Frontend Mentor. The decision to do in thi way, is because this project is only for me to pratice and my Git was become a little ugly as I update more and more repositories from my classes.

Note (05 ago 23): I studied about git workflow, and take some references in [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows), so I'll start to put my projects in different branchs to match with what I'm registranting in my Trello (I thought to use software JIRA as I'm studying about the methodologies Kanban and Scum, but my computer didn't handled to open Figma, JIRA, VScode and others thngs at the same time)

### Result Sumary

It was easy compared to the lastone, but I took 6 hours in this project. 4 hours was just studying how to fetch data from json and trying ways to use that data inside the HTML. Was a good test and I'm glad this was just a component, because I could make up for the time I wasted studying JS. The mainly content that I used for understand how works the Fetch was from these Youtube Channels [dcode](https://youtu.be/5VCY9yCZnlc) and [The coding train](https://youtu.be/uxf0--uiX0I).

## WorkIt 

At this project I had to became intimate with positions as relative and absolute, how create ellipse shape forms and organize the page to have differents kind of layout while the device changes. Here I tryed a new approach (for me) with the concepts of Mobile first that I'm learning with [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja). This project is kind a pratice for html and css, at the same time I used this as a opportunity to learn a new approach to code.
