# Frontend-Mentor-SnyderCut

In this repository I'll try to assemble every project I make from the Frontend Mentor. The decision to do in thi way, is because this project is only for me to pratice and my Git was become a little ugly as I update more and more repositories from my classes.

## Table of projects

## WorkIt 

At this project I had to became intimate with positions as relative and absolute, how create ellipse shape forms and organize the page to have differents kind of layout while the device changes. Here I tryed a new approach (for me) with the concepts of Mobile first that I'm learning with [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja). This project is kind a pratice for html and css, at the same time I used this as a opportunity to learn a new approach to code.

### Result Sumary

It was easy compared to the lastone, but I took 6 hours in this project. 4 hours was just studying how to fetch data from json and trying ways to use that data inside the HTML. Was a good test and I'm glad this was just a component, because I could make up for the time I wasted studying JS. The mainly content that I used for understand how works the Fetch was from these Youtube Channels [dcode](https://youtu.be/5VCY9yCZnlc) and [The coding train](https://youtu.be/uxf0--uiX0I).
