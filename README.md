# Frontend-Mentor-SnyderCut

In this repository I'll try to assemble every project I make from the Frontend Mentor. The decision to do in thi way, is because this project is only for me to pratice and my Git was become a little ugly as I update more and more repositories from my classes.

## Table of projects

- [WorkIt - Landing Page](#workit) - ongoing

## WorkIt 

The Project is on going. I finished the base structure and let some advices for me in future.

I'm trying to approach this with the concepts of Mobile first that I'm learning with [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja). This project is kind a pratice for html and css, at the same time I'm using this as a opportunity to learn a new approach to code.
